## Overview
This project implements a **sequence-to-sequence (encoder-decoder) neural network** using **Keras/TensorFlow** to convert numbers into their word representations.

**Example:**

The model demonstrates:
- LSTM-based sequence modeling.
- Tokenization and embedding for numerical sequences.
- Handling variable-length input/output sequences with padding.
- Training and inference pipelines for number-to-word conversion.

## Features

- Converts integers to word sequences.
- Uses Keras Tokenizer for mapping numbers to words.
- Embedding layers for sequence handling.
- Supports variable-length sequences.
- GPU-compatible for faster training.
